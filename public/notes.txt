--- Random Notes and Stuff ---

> Mui has a component, "ImageList", that will be super useful
for displaying Andi's works
  - They have different variations that allow you to include
  details and such too
> Should do a appearing/disappearing navbar
> For Firefox - no the nav, I'll probably check that feature is
   not supported and then just do a bit of different styling in
   that case.
